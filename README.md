# Wordle Remake

This is a remake of the popular Wordle game but you get a new word everytime.
It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Usage
To play the game, clone the repository and open the index.html in your browser:

Enter your guess in the input field.
Repeat until you either guess the word or run out of attempts.
Wether you win or lose, the game will start over with a new word.
If you want to modify or extend the game, clone the repository and use any code editor to open the project files.
